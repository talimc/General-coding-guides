A quick guide to archiving files on GitHub

I. Open your new account
1) Open www.github.com
2) Click "sign up for GitHub" and follow the steps to complete your account. 
That was simple! :)

II. Create a new repository
1) On the left column ("Repositories"), click on "New".
2) Enter the repository name you want. It's good practice to add a description, both so that others know as much about the repository as possible, and also for your future forgetfull self.
3) Choose the privacy feature you'd like. In case of files you would like others to have access to, choose 'public'.
4) It is good practice to start a repository with at least one file; select the 'Add a README file'. You can update it later.
5) Click 'Create repository'.
