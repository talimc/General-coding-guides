A quick guide to archiving files on GitHub

I. Open your new account
1) Open www.github.com
2) Click "sign up for GitHub" and follow the steps to complete your account. 
That was simple! :)

II. Create a new repository
1) On the left column ("Repositories"), click on "New".
2) Enter the repository name you want. It's good practice to add a description, both so that others know as much about the repository as possible, and also for your future forgetfull self.
3) Choose the privacy feature you'd like. In case of files you would like others to have access to, choose 'public'.
4) It is good practice to start a repository with at least one file; select the 'Add a README file'. You can update it later.
5) Click 'Create repository'.

III. Adding files to the repository
1) To add an existing file, click on 'Add file' and select 'Upload files'.
2) Either drag or choose your file. Again, it's good practice to add a description here. 
3) Select the 'Commit directly to the main branch' option to simply upload the file to the repository. If you select the other option of 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request', then the file and all future changes will be documented (changes are called 'pushes'). If working with collaborators, this can be a good option to do version control before changes are saved/merged in the main branch.
4) Click on 'Commit changes'.
